## To Do

- ~~Copy rubric to README~~
- Write out project needs
- Color selection
- Create logo
- Expand README to include updated needs, better Markdown
- Connect git repo to Netlify for hosting

## Rubric - Design

### Req'd Elements

- at least 4 images
- title text
- regular text
- a logo

### HTML

- `header`,`footer`,`article`,`section` used to add meaningful code.
- No `div` or `section` tags are without class or id.

### Custom Design

- Customize images and text
- Customize placement of the elements on the page (grid layout)
- Customize CSS styles applied at a minimum to paragraph/heading elements.

### Grid Based Layout

- Page utilizes a grid-based layout
- Page uses `flexbox` layout (or framework)

## Rubric - Responsiveness

### Cross-Device Compatability

- Renders on **desktop**, **mobile (Google Nexus 5)** and **tablet (Apple iPad)**
- An image's title/text renders next to the image in all viewport sizes

### Provide All Content

- All content is rendered on all devices - no hidden content on mobile
- ~~`meta` tag is included in HTML~~

## Separation of Concerns

### Styles Separated From HTML

- no inline styles in HTML document, or `style` tag

## Code Quality

### HTML Formatting Rules

- All code (HTML element names, attributes, values) are **lowercase** (except `text/DATA`)
- Code does not have trailing white spaces
- Indentation is consistent
- Code uses a new line for every block, list or table element and indent every such child.

- __**BONUS:**__ Use double-quotation for attribute values

### HTML Style Rules

- ~~HTML documents use HTML5 `<!doctype html>`~~
- Code passes HTML and CSS validators
- __**BONUS:**__ Code does not use entity references unless necessary e.g. characters with special meaning in HTML (like < and &) as well as control or “invisible” characters (like no-break spaces).
- __**BONUS:**__ Code omits type attributes for style sheets and scripts

### CSS Formatting Rules

- Code does not have trailing white spaces.
- Indentation is consistent (either all tabs or all 2 spaces or all 4 spaces etc).
- Code indents all block content, that is rules within rules as well as declarations to reflect hierarchy and improve understanding.
- Code uses a semicolon after every declaration for consistency and extensibility reasons.Code always uses a space after a property name's colon, but no space between property and colon, for consistency reasons.
- Code always use a single space between the last selector and the opening brace that begins the declaration block.
- Code always start a new line for each selector and declaration.
- Code always put a blank line (two line breaks) between rules.
- __**BONUS:**__ Code uses double quotation marks for attribute selectors or property values. Do not use quotation marks in URI values (`url()`).

### CSS Style Rules

- Code uses meaningful or generic ID and class names that are as short as possible but as long as necessary.
- Code does not use element names in conjunction with IDs or classes.
- Code uses shorthand properties where possible.
- __**BONUS:**__ Code omits unit specification after 0 values.
- __**BONUS:**__ Code includes leading 0s in decimal values for readability.
- __**BONUS:**__ Code uses 3-character hexadecimal notation where possible.
- __**BONUS:**__ Code separate words in ID and class names by a hyphen.
- __**BONUS:**__ Code avoids user agent detection as well as CSS "hacks"—try a different approach first.

### General Meta Rules

- ~~HTML templates and documents use UTF-8 encoding. (no BOM) i.e. `<meta charset="utf-8">`~~
- __**BONUS:**__ Mark todos and action items with `TODO`
